Q: Which of the following pairs fills in the blanks to make this code compile?
5: public void read() ___________ SQLException {
6: ___________ new SQLException();
7: }
A.- throw on line 5 and throw on line 6
B.- throw on line 5 and throws on line 6
C.+ throws on line 5 and throw on line 6
D.- throws on line 5 and throws on line 6
E.- None of the above. SQLException is a checked exception and cannot be thrown.
F.- None of the above. SQLException is a runtime exception and cannot be thrown.
Y: C. The method should declare that it throws an exception and the body of the method
actually would throw it. Options E and F are incorrect because both checked and
unchecked (runtime) exceptions can be declared in a method signature. Also, option F is
incorrect because SQLException is a checked exception.
---2 chapter6
Q: Which of the following changes when made independently would make this code compile? (Choose all that apply.)
1: public class StuckTurkeyCage implements AutoCloseable {
2:    public void close() throws Exception {
3:       throw new Exception("Cage door does not close");
4:
5:    public static void main(String[] args) {
6:       try (StuckTurkeyCage t = new StuckTurkeyCage()) {
7:         System.out.println("put turkeys in");
8:       }
9:    }
10: }
A.- Remove throws Exception from the declaration on line 2.
B.+ Add throws Exception to the declaration on line 5.
C.+ Change line 8 to } catch (Exception e) {}.
D.- Change line 8 to } finally {}.
E.- None of the above will make the code compile.
F.- The code already compiles as is.
Y: B, C. Option A is incorrect because it will move the compilation error to the close() method
since it does throw an exception that must be handled or declared. Option B is correct
because the unhandled exception becomes declared. Option C is correct because the exception
becomes handled. Option D is incorrect because the exception remains unhandled.
